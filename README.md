# AppleFAQ
This was a college project I had worked on for my personal final.

The webpage was built to help simplify troubleshooting an iOS device and what a normal Apple advisor would have a customer perform to make sure it was a program/code issue or if the phone needed to be replaced.

While working for Apple as an iOS advisor, this was a way to help novice and basic users learn to help themselves if they wanted to do it on their own. Calling/chatting with an advisor is always a good option.
